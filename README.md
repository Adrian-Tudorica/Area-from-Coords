# Area-from-Coords

Area Calculator from Coordinate Points (From Axis-Aligned Rectangles Coordinates)

The program receives a .txt input file.

The file contains the number of rectangles followed by their coordinates, specified as axis-aligned rectangles using the format: xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax.

The program computes and returns the total area of the figure formed by the union of all the rectangles. The rectangles may overlap partially or completely.
